I hope this email finds you well. I would like to draw your attention to our shared SharePoint document labeled "XXX," accessible via the following link: https://test.bb.com/doc1.

We kindly request your esteemed consideration in reviewing the roster of projects designated to your respective roles under the 'Automation Coverage' section. Your valuable input is sought to accurately update the 'Automation Status' column, aligning it with the current state of automation for each project. Your cooperation in assigning one of the predefined values listed below for the automation statuses is greatly appreciated:

Active
Requires Maintenance
Requires Maintenance (No Resources)
Deprecated
Moreover, I would like to kindly ask you to peruse the '2023 Automation Targets' tab. Should you identify any ongoing test automation projects absent from the 'Automation Coverage' section, we kindly urge you to relocate them accordingly.

Your kind support and involvement are sincerely valued as we work to enhance our automation processes. We extend our gratitude for your valuable assistance and collaboration.

Warm regards,

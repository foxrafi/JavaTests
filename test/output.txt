Subject: Urgent: Request for File Cleanup in Quality Management Shared Folder

Dear [Quality Management Department] Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of the Infrastructure Team to address a matter concerning the shared file in our Quality Management Department. Recently, we have noticed a significant increase in the size of the shared file, and it has come to our attention that this is impacting overall system performance.

To ensure the efficiency and optimal functioning of our systems, we kindly request that each team member takes a moment to review and clean up unnecessary files or outdated documents from the shared folder. This will not only help reduce the file size but also contribute to a more streamlined and organized workspace.

Please consider the following guidelines during the cleanup process:

1. Identify and remove any duplicate files.
2. Delete files that are no longer relevant or have become outdated.
3. Archive or move large files that are seldom accessed to a separate location, if possible.

We understand that everyone has different responsibilities, and we appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain the health of our shared infrastructure. This cleanup is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and ensuring that the shared resources are utilized effectively.

If you have any questions or concerns about the cleanup process, please feel free to reach out to the Infrastructure Team, and we will be more than happy to assist you.

We kindly request that all team members complete the cleanup by [specified date], as this will allow us to address any potential issues promptly.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and understanding. Your efforts in maintaining a clean and organized shared file space are invaluable.

Best regards,

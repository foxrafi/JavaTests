Dear Anna,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you that, currently, we don't have any immediate plans to enter information about this tool into xxx. It is intended to be an internal tool for QM, exclusively running in the test region. Moreover, once the tool is fully developed, we won't deploy it on production either.

I wanted to mention that the development process hasn't begun yet due to the unavailability of a Linux machine required for the task. Consequently, we have submitted a request to acquire one. If you have any further inquiries or require additional clarification, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Kind regards,

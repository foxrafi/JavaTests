"I experimented with several test automation scenarios, utilizing various frameworks and libraries to assess Copilot's support for implementing automated tests. Copilot seamlessly integrates with popular test frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, SerenityBDD/Cucumber/JBehave, Selenium, and wc3270 for mainframe systems. By providing a well-crafted prompt in a comment, Copilot can generate almost the entire test code for specific methods. Subsequently, these methods require minimal or no modifications to align with our testing needs. The generated code adheres to proper naming conventions, formatting styles, and error handling techniques. Additionally, by specifying keywords such as "assert," "verify," or "check," we can communicate the desired type of assertion for our tests. I successfully generated a list of Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file and a basic Selenium template code. Overall, I estimate that I saved approximately one to two hours on boilerplate code preparation over the past three days. This time-saving benefit could be even more significant for junior or regular test automation experts."

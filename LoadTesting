Dear Team,

Prior to the scheduled Jira upgrade this Saturday, comprehensive wellness checks have been conducted across various Jira projects. While solutions have been identified for numerous issues at the script level, it is imperative that we are promptly notified post-upgrade to implement these solutions in the production environment. Regrettably, due to the nature of the tasks, many of these adjustments cannot be executed prior to the upgrade. Therefore, kindly inform us upon completion of the upgrade on Saturday so that the Jira support team can commence the update of Jira scripts.

Furthermore, it is essential to include Marcin from the AAA team in this communication, as he will also need to implement certain modifications in his Groovy scripts.

Additionally, it is important to note that despite exhaustive efforts and thorough reviews of numerous critical Jira projects, jobs, configurations, workflows, and Groovy scripts, our capacity constraints have prevented us from reviewing all 1224 projects. Consequently, we have scheduled on-call availability for Sunday and the following week to address any unforeseen issues identified by users.

Best regards,
Rafal

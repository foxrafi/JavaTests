Dear TestComplete users,

The QM team has recently introduced SmartBear TestComplete version 15.59 into AAA. As indicated in the attached list, it has come to our attention that some users still have older versions installed on their servers. We kindly request that you take the necessary time to plan the upgrade to the newly onboarded version. To request the upgrade on your laptops or VDIs, please utilize the AAA myTech portal. If you require assistance with deploying it on virtual machines, please do not hesitate to reach out to us to obtain the necessary binaries.

Should you have any inquiries or require further assistance, please feel free to contact us.

Kind regards,

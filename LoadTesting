We require an additional 200 GB of storage to successfully complete the upgrade and sustain it for the next two to three weeks. Subsequently, we plan to eliminate redundant backups and uninstall all versions of the database, optimizing our storage resources. This will allow us to release the temporarily allocated 200 GB back to your storage pool.

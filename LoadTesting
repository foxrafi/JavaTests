"Dear Quality Management Leaders,

As you are aware, the Quality Management (QM) department routinely collects QM Metrics information on a monthly basis using the SharePoint spreadsheet. Additionally, we have developed a new tool called the "KPI Metric Tool" to automate the collection of as much of this data as possible.

However, it is imperative for us to identify which qTest and Jira projects should be integrated with this new "KPI Metric Tool." While some projects have already been integrated, we extend our gratitude to those who have initiated requests for integration in Jira. Nonetheless, there may be other projects that require integration.

If you have not yet submitted a formal "Request" in the Jira project of the "KPI METRIC TOOL" to add your project into the tool, we kindly request that you do so at your earliest convenience to facilitate seamless integration.

You can submit a request for onboarding your projects using the following URL:

Kind regards,"

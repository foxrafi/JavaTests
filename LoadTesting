Hello Ania,

I appreciate your efforts in reaching out to the vendor for information on the proposed fixes scheduled for this year. While I did not anticipate their willingness to incorporate such assurances in the contract, it is valuable that we have officially inquired. This allows us the option to revisit this matter later in the year if the identified issues remain unaddressed.

Regarding our potential involvement in the Beta Testing initiative, I prefer not to formally commit in writing to an immediate testing timeline due to potential constraints on my team's availability. I would appreciate the flexibility to assess our capacity and, if necessary, opt out without contractual obligations. If Bartek and Jean have no further inquiries, we can await the final approvals from the OR.

Best regards,
Urban

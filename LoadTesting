We kindly request your approval for the proposed change, involving the removal of obsolete QTest database backups and the uninstallation of PostgreSQL database version 10. Our current infrastructure utilizes PostgreSQL version 13, rendering version 10 unnecessary. The scheduled modifications will exclusively apply to the production qTest database server, specifically qddkalkdf.gdf.com. Your thorough review of the change request is appreciated, and should you have any inquiries, kindly inform us. If the proposed changes align with your expectations, we seek your approval to execute this cleanup on February 10th.

Dear [Recipient],

As you are likely aware, in our ongoing efforts to enhance Quality Management reporting and streamline our monthly reporting processes, we initiated the KPI Metric Project some time ago. Presently, we are in the midst of onboarding various projects onto the KPI Metric Tool. 

Given the frequency with which we encounter testers and address similar inquiries repeatedly, we have conceived the idea of providing a demonstration of the current iteration of the KPI Metric tool. This demonstration aims to showcase its design, functionality, and the necessary integration steps for your projects, with the objective of facilitating a smoother transition process. 

We cordially invite you to participate in the tool demo. Please note that while the tool is still in development, we anticipate introducing further enhancements and modifications in the coming months. This session will also serve as an opportunity for us to address any questions or concerns you may have.

Kind regards, [Your Name]
Certainly, aligning your test automation team's goals with the overarching objective can enhance overall synergy. Here are three more specific goals:

1. **Enhance Platform Simplification:** Develop automated test suites that streamline the testing process, reducing complexity and enhancing ease of use for quality management tools. This will contribute to the Systems' objective of simplifying technology platforms, ultimately improving efficiency and peace of mind for internal and external clients.

2. **Standardize Testing Processes:** Implement standardized testing methodologies and frameworks across all quality management tools, ensuring consistency and reliability in testing practices. By adhering to standardized processes, the team contributes to the Systems' goal of standardization, enabling smoother integration and interoperability between different systems.

3. **Promote Shared Services Utilization:** Collaborate with other teams to leverage shared testing infrastructure and resources effectively. By sharing expertise and resources, the team can create capacity and optimize resource allocation, aligning with the Systems' strategy of leveraging shared services to achieve the "35" strategy. This promotes efficiency, innovation, and risk management across the organization.

Certainly! Here are two more specific goals aligned with your team's overarching goal:

1. Enhance Performance Testing Efficiency: Implement automation techniques and best practices in Neoload and JMeter to streamline performance testing processes, reducing testing cycle times by X% within the next quarter/year.

2. Foster Continuous Improvement: Establish a feedback loop mechanism to collect insights from performance testing results, enabling iterative enhancements to technology platforms for improved reliability, scalability, and performance, thereby contributing to the "35" strategy's objective of process excellence and innovation.

Regrettably, we do not believe that Openshift is a viable alternative in this scenario. There is uncertainty regarding support for Windows containers on Openshift, and given the significant resource limitations and the absence of allocated budget by QM, it is not feasible to proceed with this option. Additionally, our testers require daily connectivity using RDP client, and it remains uncertain whether this functionality can be achieved with Windows on Openshift. Therefore, we prefer to maintain our current standard VMs.

Following our previous discussions on this matter, and considering our current requirements and recent changes in the KPI Metric application design, it has been concluded that the qcltasap1.com server is no longer necessary. Consequently, I have submitted a decommission request today. Instead, we would like to acquire four Windows VM servers.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further inquiries or require clarification.


"Dear Quality Management Leaders,

As you are aware, the Quality Management (QM) department routinely collects QM Metrics information on a monthly basis using the SharePoint spreadsheet. Additionally, we have developed a new tool called the "KPI Metric Tool" to automate the collection of as much of this data as possible.

However, it is imperative for us to identify which qTest and Jira projects should be integrated with this new "KPI Metric Tool." While some projects have already been integrated, we extend our gratitude to those who have initiated requests for integration in Jira. Nonetheless, there may be other projects that require integration.

If you have not yet submitted a formal "Request" in the Jira project of the "KPI METRIC TOOL" to add your project into the tool, we kindly request that you do so at your earliest convenience to facilitate seamless integration.

You can submit a request for onboarding your projects using the following URL:

Kind regards,"

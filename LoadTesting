The main difference between browser-centric and user-centric web performance metrics is the perspective from which they are measured. Browser-centric metrics are focused on how the web application performs from the perspective of the browser, while user-centric metrics are focused on how the web application performs from the perspective of the user.

Browser-centric metrics typically measure things like page load times, resource sizes, and network requests. These metrics provide developers with insights into how the web application performs from a technical standpoint, and can help identify areas where optimizations can be made to improve performance.

On the other hand, user-centric metrics are focused on how the user experiences the web application. They measure things like bounce rates, conversion rates, and engagement time. These metrics provide developers and website owners with insights into how users are interacting with the website, and can help identify areas where the user experience can be improved.

Overall, both browser-centric and user-centric metrics are important for understanding and optimizing the performance of web applications. Browser-centric metrics are important for identifying technical issues that can impact performance, while user-centric metrics are important for understanding how users are interacting with the website and how to improve the user experience.


There are several performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of web applications. Some of the most common ones include:

1. Response Time: This is the time taken by a web application to respond to a user request. A lower response time is better as it indicates that the application is able to process user requests quickly.

2. Load Time: This is the time taken by a web page to load completely. A faster load time is better as it can help improve user experience and reduce bounce rates.

3. Page Size: This refers to the size of a web page in terms of its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources. Smaller page sizes can help improve load times and reduce bandwidth usage.

4. Number of Requests: This refers to the number of requests made by a web page to the server to load all its resources. Reducing the number of requests can help improve load times.

5. Error Rate: This is the percentage of requests that result in errors. A lower error rate is better as it indicates that the application is functioning properly.

6. Throughput: This is the number of requests that a web application can handle per second. A higher throughput is better as it indicates that the application is able to handle high traffic volumes.

7. Availability: This is the percentage of time that a web application is available for use. A higher availability rate is better as it indicates that the application is reliable and can be accessed by users when needed.






Browser-centric metrics are performance metrics that focus on the user experience of the web application from the perspective of the browser. Some of the most common browser-centric performance metrics include:

1. First Contentful Paint (FCP): This is the time taken for the first piece of content to be rendered on the user's screen. This metric indicates how quickly users can see something meaningful on the page.

2. Time to Interactive (TTI): This is the time taken for the page to become fully interactive. This metric indicates how long users have to wait before they can interact with the page.

3. First Input Delay (FID): This is the time taken for the browser to respond to the user's first interaction with the page, such as clicking a button or entering text. This metric indicates how responsive the application is to user input.

4. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): This is the time taken for the largest piece of content on the page to be rendered. This metric indicates how quickly users can see the main content of the page.

5. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): This metric measures how much the content of the page moves around as it loads. A higher CLS can be frustrating for users as it can cause buttons or links to move around while they're trying to click on them.

These metrics can be measured using tools such as Google's Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or Chrome DevTools. By monitoring these metrics, developers can identify areas where their web application may be underperforming and take steps to optimize its performance.






User-centric metrics are performance metrics that focus on the user experience of the web application from the perspective of the user. Some of the most common user-centric performance metrics include:

1. Time to First Byte (TTFB): This is the time taken for the user's browser to receive the first byte of data from the server. A lower TTFB is better as it indicates that the server is responding quickly to user requests.

2. Bounce Rate: This is the percentage of users who leave the website after viewing only one page. A higher bounce rate can indicate that users are having a poor experience on the website.

3. Conversion Rate: This is the percentage of users who complete a desired action on the website, such as making a purchase or filling out a form. A higher conversion rate indicates that users are finding the website useful and engaging.

4. Engagement Time: This is the amount of time that users spend on the website. A longer engagement time can indicate that users are finding the website interesting and engaging.

5. Retention Rate: This is the percentage of users who return to the website after their first visit. A higher retention rate indicates that users are finding the website valuable and are likely to return in the future.

These metrics can be measured using tools such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Heap. By monitoring these metrics, developers and website owners can gain insights into how users are interacting with their website and take steps to improve their user experience.

I am uncertain why the 2023.6.-1.-1 version is being proposed as an upgrade for our current outdated installation of gtest explorer. Kindly review the screenshot attached by Imran earlier for reference. Additionally, it is difficult to believe that since 2021, and with the release date of 7.2.8.6, there have been no upgrades to this software. Is this software still supported for on-premise customers? Could you please provide clarification on this matter and advise us on our available options?
Dear Leadership Team,

I would like to express my gratitude to Anna for sending out the reminder regarding the QM Test Automation group. 

Updating this group is paramount as it functions as a central point for all automation testers at dddd to remain abreast of significant developments in test automation within our organization. By ensuring the inclusion of all relevant testers, both dddd employees and consultants, you can ensure that everyone receives timely updates about new versions of tools integrated into dddd, upcoming conferences, and any other pertinent information crucial for maintaining alignment across the team.

Recently, there have been instances where testers did not receive emails sent by Anna to the group. I urge all of you to promptly update the group to prevent any oversights and ensure that all team members are included in the information-sharing process.

Kind regards,

[Your Name]

Hello Sam,

I apologize for the delayed notification. During recent discussions with the STAR team regarding the traffic proxy, it has come to our attention that it may be necessary to review the data stored on the abc server. If it is not too late, could we kindly request temporary access for Leonid to conduct a quick review?

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

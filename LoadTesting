Hi Geoff,

I hope you are well. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of obtaining a GitHub Copilot license for a few days. Let me explain the plan: next week, a large group of partners and principals will be in Krakow for an offsite event. There will be numerous meetings and discussions, and one of the topics Anna will cover is GitHub Copilot. For this presentation, I would like to record a demo for Anna to potentially show to the partners.

Could you please grant me access to GitHub Copilot by the end of this week? If so, what information do you need from me?

Thank you,
[Your Name]

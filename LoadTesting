Certainly! GitHub Copilot has been reported to significantly improve productivity in software testing and development. Here's a summary of the impact:

**Before GitHub Copilot:**
- Testers would write test scripts manually, which is time-consuming and prone to human error.
- The process could be slow due to the need for frequent revisions and debugging.

**After GitHub Copilot:**
- GitHub Copilot offers autocomplete-style suggestions, which speeds up coding¹.
- It helps in generating code based on natural language prompts, reducing the effort required to write test scripts².
- Testers have reported that it has saved them considerable time, although specific percentages of time saved are not always documented.

**Percentage Reduction:**
- While exact figures vary, one source suggests that if the time saved were measured, GitHub Copilot would have already paid for itself¹.
- Another source indicates that developers using GitHub Copilot were objectively faster at completing coding challenges².

In conclusion, while the percentage reduction in time may not be explicitly stated, the qualitative data suggests a substantial decrease in the time required for automating test scripts with GitHub Copilot. Testers and developers report feeling more productive and completing tasks more quickly.

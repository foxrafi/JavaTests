This intermittent issue occurs sporadically across various repositories and does not appear to be isolated to a specific one. While downloads may proceed smoothly for certain repositories, the recurring factor appears to be the size of the repository in question. Notably, when attempting to checkout a sizable repository for the first time, there is a likelihood of encountering the aforementioned error interrupting the download process. This observation extends beyond the current repository under consideration to encompass similar experiences across other repositories. It is suggested that a thorough examination of the logs may provide valuable insights into potential underlying causes. Failing such examination, pinpointing the exact root cause of the issue may prove challenging.

Certainly, while the current approach is acceptable, it's important to avoid using the "Description" label for the two fields in Jira, as all Jira fields are universally visible and could potentially lead to user confusion. Kindly suggest two alternative names that do not include the "Description" label.

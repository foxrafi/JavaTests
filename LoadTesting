Dear Brian,

I extend my gratitude for your assistance.

Could you kindly provide further detail on the approval process? Specifically, I am interested in understanding the stakeholders involved and the procedural steps. Equipped with this knowledge, we may expedite proceedings and avoid impeding the development cycle. In addition to addressing security concerns, the latest influxdb release boasts features essential to our application, such as support for Buckets. The prolonged wait for approved binaries to be downloaded into BBH is perplexing, especially considering previous approvals. It appears that each upgrade prolongs the process by over a month. Any guidance or assistance you could offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you sincerely.

I am seeking an update regarding the status of the following request: my team is currently utilizing an outdated version of InfluxDB that harbors multiple security vulnerabilities, hindering our ability to conduct necessary maintenance tasks. Could you kindly provide insight into the progress of addressing this matter?

If the situation becomes more intricate due to the introduction of these new terms, it will be imperative for us to discuss with Tricentis the potential necessity of obtaining a temporary license post-6/4 with identical configurations to our current setup, should negotiations extend beyond anticipated timelines. If you could provide an estimation of the expected duration, we would greatly appreciate it as it will enable us to proactively address any potential impact on our performance testing activities scheduled for June.


1. Could you provide clarification on the definition of a VU block and its inclusion in our previous contract discussions?

2. What prompted the division of the 3000 VU package into SKU298 and SKU530? Could you elaborate on the rationale behind this decision?

3. With SKU295, are we afforded the capability to execute an additional four concurrent tests alongside SKU2987?

4. In reference to SKU933's designation for on-premise implementation, does this imply that the preceding SKUs are exclusively for cloud-based usage?

5. Considering our expenditure of $121,000 last year (subject to verification by Jean), it appears that this year's cost has decreased to $114,806.12. Could you confirm this reduction and provide insight into the reasons behind it?

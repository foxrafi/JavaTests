Achieving proficiency in GitHub Copilot entails mastering the art of crafting precise and accurate prompts. Writing prompts correctly ensures that Copilot generates code effectively and accurately. However, attaining mastery in prompt formulation is a skill that requires time and practice to develop

We experimented with several test automation scenarios, utilizing various frameworks and libraries to assess Copilot's support for implementing automated tests.
Copilot seamlessly integrates with popular test frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, SerenityBDD/Cucumber/JBehave, Selenium, and wc3270 for mainframe systems, used in BBH.
By providing a well-crafted prompt in a comment, Copilot can generate almost the entire test code for specific methods.
Subsequently, these methods require minimal or no modifications to align with our testing needs. The generated code adheres to proper naming conventions, formatting styles, and error handling techniques.
Additionally, by specifying keywords such as "assert," "verify," or "check," we can communicate the desired type of assertion for our tests. With proper prompts, you can generate even tests for boundary/edge cases.
I successfully generated a list of Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file and standard Selenium template code. Overall, I estimate that I saved approximately one to two hours on boilerplate code preparation over the past three days. This time-saving benefit could be even more significant for junior or regular test automation experts.

Slide 1: Integration with Popular Test FrameworksGitHub Copilot integrates seamlessly with popular test frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, SerenityBDD/Cucumber/JBehave, Selenium, and wc3270 for mainframe systems.This compatibility allows us to leverage existing frameworks and libraries, reducing the learning curve and enabling faster test implementation.For example, by providing a well-crafted prompt in a comment, Copilot can generate almost the entire test code for specific methods, which then require minimal or no modifications to align with our testing needs.Slide 2: Code Quality and EfficiencyThe code generated by Copilot adheres to proper naming conventions, formatting styles, and error handling techniques, ensuring high-quality code.By specifying keywords such as “assert,” “verify,” or “check,” we can communicate the desired type of assertion for our tests. With proper prompts, Copilot can even generate tests for boundary/edge cases.This leads to more robust and comprehensive test coverage, improving the reliability of our software.Slide 3: Time Savings and ProductivityOver the past three days, using Copilot for tasks like generating a list of Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file and standard Selenium template code saved approximately one to two hours on boilerplate code preparation.This time-saving benefit could be even more significant for junior or regular test automation experts, potentially saving hundreds of hours over the course of a project.These time savings translate directly into cost savings and increased productivity for the company.
 Sure, let’s consider a simple test scenario where we are testing a login functionality of a web application using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG in Java.Here’s a basic test case without using GitHub Copilot:import org.openqa.selenium.By;import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;import org.testng.Assert;import org.testng.annotations.AfterMethod;import org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;import org.testng.annotations.Test;public class LoginTest { WebDriver driver; @BeforeMethod public void setup() { System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path_to_chromedriver"); driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get("https://www.example.com/login"); } @Test public void testLogin() { WebElement usernameField = driver.findElement(By.id("username")); WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id("password")); WebElement loginButton = driver.findElement(By.id("login")); usernameField.sendKeys("testuser"); passwordField.sendKeys("testpassword"); loginButton.click(); Assert.assertEquals(driver.getCurrentUrl(), "https://www.example.com/home"); } @AfterMethod public void teardown() { driver.quit(); }}Now, let’s see how much time we could save with GitHub Copilot:Writing the test method (5-10 minutes): With a well-crafted prompt, Copilot can generate the entire test method, including finding the web elements, performing actions on them, and asserting the expected outcome.Setting up and tearing down the test (5 minutes): Copilot can generate the @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod annotations and their corresponding methods, saving time on setting up and tearing down the test.Error handling (5-10 minutes): Copilot can generate code for proper error handling techniques, saving time on thinking about and implementing these scenarios.Code formatting and conventions (5 minutes): The code generated by Copilot adheres to proper naming conventions and formatting styles, saving time on code reviews and refactoring.In total, for this simple test scenario, we could save approximately 20 to 30 minutes with GitHub Copilot. For more complex scenarios or for less experienced developers, the time savings could be even greater. Please note that these are rough estimates and actual time savings may vary.
 Sure, let’s consider a simple test scenario where we are testing a login functionality of a web application using Cucumber or Serenity BDD.Here’s a basic test case without using GitHub Copilot:Feature: Login Feature Scenario: Successful Login with Valid Credentials Given User is on Home Page When User Navigate to LogIn Page And User enters UserName and Password Then Message displayed Login Successfullypublic class Steps { @Given("^User is on Home Page$") public void user_is_on_Home_Page() { // code to navigate to home page } @When("^User Navigate to LogIn Page$") public void user_Navigate_to_LogIn_Page() { // code to navigate to login page } @When("^User enters UserName and Password$") public void user_enters_UserName_and_Password() { // code to enter username and password } @Then("^Message displayed Login Successfully$") public void message_displayed_Login_Successfully() { // code to check login success message }}Now, let’s see how much time we could save with GitHub Copilot:Writing the feature file (5-10 minutes): With a well-crafted prompt, Copilot can generate the entire feature file, including defining the scenario and the steps.Writing the step definitions (10-20 minutes): Copilot can generate the step definitions in Java, including the methods and the annotations.Error handling (5-10 minutes): Copilot can generate code for proper error handling techniques, saving time on thinking about and implementing these scenarios.Code formatting and conventions (5 minutes): The code generated by Copilot adheres to proper naming conventions and formatting styles, saving time on code reviews and refactoring.In total, for this simple test scenario, we could save approximately 25 to 45 minutes with GitHub Copilot. For more complex scenarios or for less experienced developers, the time savings could be even greater. Please note that these are rough estimates and actual time savings may vary


Writing the test method (10-20 minutes): With a well-crafted prompt, Copilot can generate the entire test method, including finding the form elements, entering border and edge case values, submitting the form, and checking the form submission result.
Setting up and tearing down the test (5 minutes): Copilot can generate the @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod annotations and their corresponding methods, saving time on setting up and tearing down the test.
Error handling (5-10 minutes): Copilot can generate code for proper error handling techniques, saving time on thinking about and implementing these scenarios.

If the situation becomes more intricate due to the introduction of these new terms, it will be imperative for us to discuss with Tricentis the potential necessity of obtaining a temporary license post-6/4 with identical configurations to our current setup, should negotiations extend beyond anticipated timelines. If you could provide an estimation of the expected duration, we would greatly appreciate it as it will enable us to proactively address any potential impact on our performance testing activities scheduled for June.


1. Could you provide clarification on the definition of a VU block and its inclusion in our previous contract discussions?

2. What prompted the division of the 3000 VU package into SKU298 and SKU530? Could you elaborate on the rationale behind this decision?

3. With SKU295, are we afforded the capability to execute an additional four concurrent tests alongside SKU2987?

4. In reference to SKU933's designation for on-premise implementation, does this imply that the preceding SKUs are exclusively for cloud-based usage?

5. Considering our expenditure of $121,000 last year (subject to verification by Jean), it appears that this year's cost has decreased to $114,806.12. Could you confirm this reduction and provide insight into the reasons behind it?

Kindly ensure that the "Test Automation Status" column is updated for your respective projects. This column should reflect one of the following four values:

1. Active: For projects where test automation is actively developed by your test team.
2. Deprecated: For projects that no longer require further maintenance.
3. Maintenance (Under Control): For projects that are not actively developed but are regularly maintained by your Quality Management (QM) team on a daily basis.
4. Maintenance (No Control): For projects that are not actively developed, not deprecated, but lack the necessary resources for ongoing maintenance.

It is essential to maintain accurate and up-to-date information in the specified column to facilitate efficient project management and ensure clarity within the system. Should you have any questions or need clarification regarding the values and their appropriate usage, do not hesitate to seek assistance from the relevant team.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.







Certainly! In the software test automation field, the status of work for test regression suites can be represented by various states. Here are some possible status states for test regression suites:

1. **Active**: The test regression suite is actively being developed and updated to accommodate new features or changes in the application under test.

2. **Stable**: The test regression suite has reached a stable state where it is successfully running against the current version of the application, and no major issues are being reported.

3. **Needs Maintenance**: The test regression suite requires some maintenance due to minor issues or updates in the application that have affected test cases.

4. **Obsolete**: The test regression suite is outdated and no longer relevant due to significant changes in the application or testing requirements.

5. **Retired**: The test regression suite is no longer in use and has been officially retired from the testing process.

6. **Blocked**: The test regression suite is currently blocked from execution due to some technical or environmental issues.

7. **In Progress**: The test regression suite is currently being worked on or improved by the test automation engineers.

8. **Scheduled**: The test regression suite is scheduled for execution at a specific date and time.

9. **Failed**: The test regression suite has encountered failures during the last execution, and investigation or fixing is needed.

10. **Pending Review**: The test regression suite is awaiting review and approval before it can be included in the regular testing process.

11. **Partially Automated**: The test regression suite is partially automated, and work is ongoing to complete the automation for all relevant test cases.

12. **Completed**: The test regression suite has been fully developed and automated, and no further updates are currently required.

It's important to note that the specific status states may vary depending on the organization's processes, testing tools, and project requirements. Test automation engineers should ensure that the status of test regression suites is accurately maintained and communicated to the relevant stakeholders for effective test management and decision-making.

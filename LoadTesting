Subject: Request for Approval to Update Docker Images for Selenium Hub

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance and approval for an important update that our Software Test Engineers require in order to maintain the efficiency and reliability of our testing infrastructure.

As you are aware, our Selenium Hub currently runs on Docker images version 3.141, which is now considerably outdated. To ensure the smooth functioning of our testing environment and to leverage the latest features and security improvements, we need to upgrade these Docker images to version 4.x.

In order to proceed with this update, the Cloud Engineering Team has requested that we obtain approval from our Senior Vice President. This additional layer of approval is essential for changes of this nature to ensure alignment with our overall technology strategy and resource allocation.

To facilitate this approval process, we have already created two Jira requests that outline the details of this update:

1. Jira Ticket KKK-233: [Provide a brief description of this ticket and its relevance to the update.]

2. Jira Ticket YYY-78: [Provide a brief description of this ticket and its relevance to the update.]

I kindly request your support in presenting this request to the Senior Vice President for review and approval. Your endorsement and guidance will greatly assist in expediting this critical update and help us maintain the high quality of our testing infrastructure.

If you require any additional information or documentation to present this request effectively, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or our Software Test Engineers team.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to your guidance on how best to proceed. Your support is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

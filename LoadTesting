All closed, completed, or resolved issues within the TOD (Time of Delivery) framework, lacking any assigned value in the Resolution field, have been systematically updated to reflect the "Done" resolution status. Additionally, a comprehensive review of project workflows was conducted, resulting in the implementation of a new procedural step mandating the entry of resolution details upon issue closure or resolution. This proactive approach aims to mitigate similar occurrences in the future.

To split the high-level objective into more granular Key Results (KRs) for quarters, we can focus on specific measurable outcomes aligned with the objective. Here's a breakdown:

**Quarter 1:**

KR1. By the end of Q1, have X number of test automation templates created and documented for use by other testers.
   
KR2. Quantify the integration progress of the framework into X number of ongoing projects by the end of Q1.

KR3. Measure the time saved in onboarding new testers and projects without the Central Team's assistance. Aim for a reduction from 2 months to X weeks, excluding infra wait time.

Initiatives:
- IN1. Define and document a set of test automation templates and libraries compliant with the automation strategy.
- IN2. Research and assess emerging test automation technologies for potential integration into the framework standards.

**Quarter 2:**

KR1. Increase the count of test automation templates by an additional Y% compared to Q1.
   
KR2. Achieve full integration of the framework into X% more ongoing projects compared to the previous quarter.

KR3. Continue to measure and optimize the time saved in onboarding new testers and projects. Aim for further reduction from Q1's achieved time.

Initiatives:
- IN3. Implement a Traceability matrix tool within the automation framework to enhance project visibility and tracking.
- IN4. Begin development of the KPI Metric Tool integrated into the automation framework for comprehensive performance measurement.

**Quarter 3:**

KR1. Reach a total count of Z test automation templates available for use by other testers by the end of Q3.
   
KR2. Ensure the framework is fully integrated into all ongoing projects by the end of Q3.

KR3. Validate and finalize the time saved in onboarding without the Central Team's involvement, ensuring consistency with the targeted reduction.

Initiatives:
- IN4. Complete the development and implementation of the KPI Metric Tool, enabling thorough performance measurement within the automation framework.

**Quarter 4:**

KR1. Evaluate and refine existing test automation templates based on feedback and emerging needs.
   
KR2. Monitor and sustain the full integration of the framework into ongoing projects, ensuring continued usage and effectiveness.

KR3. Conduct a comprehensive review of the onboarding process, identifying any further opportunities for efficiency improvement.

Initiatives:
- IN5. Establish a feedback mechanism to gather insights from testers and projects, informing iterative improvements to the automation framework.
- IN6. Plan for future enhancements and advancements in test automation technology to maintain competitiveness and effectiveness.

These granular KRs and associated initiatives should help in achieving the overarching objective of increasing the effectiveness of Test Automation Frameworks and streamlining the onboarding process for new automation projects.

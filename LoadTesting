Dear test leaders,

We are reaching out to inquire about the utilization of the LT001 user account from the production environment in your testing procedures, whether manual or automated. Our concern stems from the unique nature of this account, which possesses a fixed password and, to the best of our knowledge, should not be employed by the Quality Management (QM) team for testing purposes. Nonetheless, recognizing the unpredictability of operational scenarios, it is possible that some of you may currently be utilizing this account. Kindly inform us of any such usage, as there are plans underway to transfer ownership of this account to the infrastructure teams.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

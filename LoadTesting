Subject: Discussion Regarding Potential Onboarding of Performance Test Developer

Dear [Outsourcing Manager's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I would like to discuss a recent interview conducted with a candidate from your team for the position of Senior Performance Test Developer. The candidate presented themselves effectively during the interview, demonstrating strong interpersonal skills and a proactive attitude. While their technical expertise is currently assessed to be between a junior and regular level, closer to the latter, I believe there is potential for growth and development within our team.

In light of this, I am considering onboarding the candidate for a provisional period of two to three months. During this time, one of our seasoned team members would serve as a mentor to facilitate their integration into our project. However, it is crucial to communicate clearly that the candidate's current technical proficiency falls below the senior level required for the role.

To ensure transparency and set expectations, I propose articulating the following terms:

1. **Provisional Onboarding Period:** The candidate will be brought on board for a probationary period of two to three months.

2. **Mentorship:** An experienced team member will be assigned to mentor the candidate and support their professional growth during this period.

3. **Performance Review:** After three months, a comprehensive performance review will be conducted to assess the candidate's progress and alignment with the senior performance tester role.

4. **Possible Replacement:** If, during the review, it is determined that the candidate has not reached the expected level of technical proficiency required for a senior role, we may consider seeking a replacement.

I believe that fostering an environment of clear communication and structured mentorship will enable the candidate to make substantial progress within the designated timeframe. Your support in facilitating this arrangement would be greatly appreciated.

I am open to further discussion and collaboration to ensure a smooth transition and successful integration of the candidate into our team. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]

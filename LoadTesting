The Performance Testing Team operates as a service center, engaging in multiple performance projects for various teams. While we acknowledge your tracking of performance testing tasks within your JIRA project, it's imperative to adhere to our established protocol mandated by Systems management. Hence, for any performance test project involving our team, we kindly request you to initiate a request within our designated JIRA project. Should you require additional clarification or wish to discuss this matter further, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your cooperation and understanding are greatly appreciated.

Dear Anna,

I trust this message finds you well. I appreciate your prompt response and the provision of the new Neoload license.

Upon attempting to activate the license following the import process, an error was encountered on our usual shared license activation site. However, upon further exploration within our customer account on your website, I discovered an alternative license with a more accurate expiration date set to June 4th, as opposed to the initially indicated date of June 26th. I have successfully imported this alternative license.

It appears that the initial license may have been inadvertently deactivated by your license team. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to confirm that we still possess the agreed-upon 3000 shared licenses.

We plan to conduct thorough testing on this new license throughout the week and will promptly communicate any issues that may arise.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to continued collaboration.

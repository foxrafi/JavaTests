Hello Mahendar,

We have procured the solution from Tricentis and would greatly appreciate your assistance in conducting research to ascertain the current licensing terms under which the bundled JDK is distributed to users. As Elasticsearch was deployed at the request of Tricentis, we presume you possess insights into the licensing terms applicable to the software utilized in your product/solution. Please feel free to reach out should you require any additional information or clarification. 

Thank you.966616Dear Dan,

I am reaching out to formally request permission to archive recordings from the Global Test Automation Forum, as well as recordings and training materials related to JIRA, within the Show & Share portal. The content in question remains relevant and valuable for ongoing use by our system department. We believe that leveraging the sophisticated video-supporting features of the Show & Share platform will enhance accessibility and utility for all stakeholders. I have previously discussed this matter with David, who suggested seeking your approval. Should you require any additional information or have further inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Rafal

Based on the data provided in the image, itâ€™s clear that using GitHub Copilot has led to significant time savings in code writing. The percentage reduction in time ranges from 16.67% to 40.00%.

Here are some potential conclusions for higher management:

Increased Efficiency: The use of GitHub Copilot has consistently resulted in a reduction in the time spent writing code. This increased efficiency could lead to faster project completions.
Cost Savings: The time savings translate directly into cost savings as less time spent on coding means less labor cost.
Productivity Boost: With GitHub Copilot, developers can focus more on problem-solving and innovative aspects of the project, boosting overall productivity.
Learning Tool: GitHub Copilot can also serve as a learning tool for less experienced developers, helping them to understand best coding practices and improving their skills over time.
In conclusion, the adoption of GitHub Copilot could be a strategic move to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and foster a learning environment. It would be beneficial to consider its wider implementation across all coding projects.

Certainly! Here are two more specific goals aligned with your team's overarching goal:

1. Enhance Performance Testing Efficiency: Implement automation techniques and best practices in Neoload and JMeter to streamline performance testing processes, reducing testing cycle times by X% within the next quarter/year.

2. Foster Continuous Improvement: Establish a feedback loop mechanism to collect insights from performance testing results, enabling iterative enhancements to technology platforms for improved reliability, scalability, and performance, thereby contributing to the "35" strategy's objective of process excellence and innovation.

Regrettably, we do not believe that Openshift is a viable alternative in this scenario. There is uncertainty regarding support for Windows containers on Openshift, and given the significant resource limitations and the absence of allocated budget by QM, it is not feasible to proceed with this option. Additionally, our testers require daily connectivity using RDP client, and it remains uncertain whether this functionality can be achieved with Windows on Openshift. Therefore, we prefer to maintain our current standard VMs.

Following our previous discussions on this matter, and considering our current requirements and recent changes in the KPI Metric application design, it has been concluded that the qcltasap1.com server is no longer necessary. Consequently, I have submitted a decommission request today. Instead, we would like to acquire four Windows VM servers.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further inquiries or require clarification.


"Dear Quality Management Leaders,

As you are aware, the Quality Management (QM) department routinely collects QM Metrics information on a monthly basis using the SharePoint spreadsheet. Additionally, we have developed a new tool called the "KPI Metric Tool" to automate the collection of as much of this data as possible.

However, it is imperative for us to identify which qTest and Jira projects should be integrated with this new "KPI Metric Tool." While some projects have already been integrated, we extend our gratitude to those who have initiated requests for integration in Jira. Nonetheless, there may be other projects that require integration.

If you have not yet submitted a formal "Request" in the Jira project of the "KPI METRIC TOOL" to add your project into the tool, we kindly request that you do so at your earliest convenience to facilitate seamless integration.

You can submit a request for onboarding your projects using the following URL:

Kind regards,"

**Subject:** Congratulations and Special Thanks - GitHub Copilot Access Granted!

Dear Team,

We are proud to announce a bold step forward for our department. Despite ongoing legal considerations surrounding GenAI technology, our management has confidently procured **20 GitHub Copilot licenses** for our team. This decision reflects a calculated risk deemed acceptable, as our automated testing processes are not deployed in production environments. This strategic move underscores our leadership's commitment to fostering innovation while maintaining prudence.

A special shout-out to the POC team - **Olga, Sergey, Amadeusz, and Ania** - whose tireless efforts over the past three weeks have been instrumental in reaching this great outcome. Your hard work and dedication have paved the way for this momentous occasion.

The selection for GitHub Copilot access was based on the **positive feedback** from your managers and an insightful analysis of your **Bitbucket activity**. Your exceptional performance has shone through, and we are confident that GitHub Copilot will serve as a catalyst for even greater achievements in automation testing.

Please note that the usage of GitHub Copilot will be **monitored throughout the year**, and based on its success, we anticipate the introduction of additional AI-based tools within BBH. For assistance in configuring your license, please reach out to the **QM Test Automation Team**.

Join us in celebrating both this collective success and the individual contributions that have led us here.

Congratulations once again to everyone, especially our POC team!

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]

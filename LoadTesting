Hello Sam,

I apologize for the delayed notification. During recent discussions with the STAR team regarding the traffic proxy, it has come to our attention that it may be necessary to review the data stored on the abc server. If it is not too late, could we kindly request temporary access for Leonid to conduct a quick review?

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

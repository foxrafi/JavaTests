**Objective:**  
Streamline the onboarding process for new automation projects by establishing robust Test Automation Frameworks.

**Key Results (OKRs):**

1. **KR1:** Define protocols and standards for test automation to comply with 35 strategy.
   
2. **KR2:** Incorporate emerging test automation technologies into the test automation framework standards.

3. **KR3:** Implement a Traceability Matrix tool within the automation framework.

4. **KR4:** Develop a KPI Metric Tool integrated into the automation framework.

5. **KR5:** Compare support costs at different levels:
   - **KR5.1:** Without the Central Team: Reduce onboarding time for new testers and projects from 2 months to 2-3 weeks.
   - **KR5.2:** With the Central Team: Ensure onboarding process takes no longer than 2-3 weeks, excluding wait time for infrastructure teams.

**Identified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1. **KPI1:** Annual count of test automation templates created for use by other testers.
   
2. **KPI2:** Track and collect utilization metrics for the test automation frameworks developed by the Central team automatically in Grafana.
   
3. **KPI3:** Quantify the number of projects integrating the frameworks into their operations.

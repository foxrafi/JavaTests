Of course! Here's a merged list of questions to ask the development team before running software performance tests, including both the initial list and the additional questions:

1. **Expected User Load:**
   - What is the expected number of concurrent users or transactions that the system needs to support?
   - Are there any peak usage times or specific events that could cause a spike in user activity?

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Can you provide details about different types of users and their behaviors? (e.g., regular users, power users, administrators)
   - Do different user roles have different access levels or permissions?

3. **Data Volume and Variability:**
   - What is the size of the typical dataset that the application will be working with?
   - Are there scenarios where the dataset size could increase significantly?

4. **Data Growth:**
   - How fast is the data expected to grow over time? (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly growth rates)
   - Are there mechanisms in place for data archiving or cleanup?

5. **Hardware and Infrastructure:**
   - What is the underlying hardware and infrastructure setup? (e.g., server specifications, network configuration)
   - Are there load balancers or other components that distribute traffic?

6. **Third-Party Integrations:**
   - Are there any external services or APIs that the application relies on?
   - What is the expected response time and reliability of these external services?

7. **Caching and Optimization:**
   - Are there caching mechanisms in place? (e.g., database caching, content delivery networks)
   - Are there any performance optimization techniques that have been implemented?

8. **Database and Storage:**
   - What type of database is being used? (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)
   - How is the database schema structured? Are there any indexing strategies in place?

9. **Scalability and Redundancy:**
   - How does the application handle horizontal or vertical scaling?
   - Are there plans for failover mechanisms or redundancy in case of hardware or software failures?

10. **Current Performance Metrics:**
    - Are there any existing performance metrics or benchmarks that the team monitors?
    - Are there any known performance bottlenecks or issues?

11. **Development and Test Environments:**
    - What environments (e.g., development, testing, staging, production) will the software be deployed to?
    - Are the test environments representative of the production environment?

12. **Performance Testing Goals:**
    - What are the specific goals of the performance tests? (e.g., response time, throughput, resource utilization)
    - Are there any specific scenarios or use cases that need to be tested?

13. **Concurrency and Workload:**
    - How does the application handle simultaneous requests from multiple users?
    - Are there any background tasks, scheduled jobs, or batch processes that impact the system's capacity?

14. **Geographic Distribution:**
    - Will the application be used by users from different geographic locations?
    - Are there any specific regions where the user load might be concentrated?

15. **Network Latency and Bandwidth:**
    - Are there any expected constraints on network latency or available bandwidth?
    - How does the application handle slow or unreliable network connections?

16. **Security and Authentication:**
    - Are there security mechanisms in place, such as authentication and authorization?
    - How does security impact the performance of the application?

17. **Error Handling and Logging:**
    - How are errors and exceptions handled within the application?
    - What level of logging is implemented, and how might it impact performance?

18. **Session Management:**
    - How are user sessions managed? Are sessions stored in memory, databases, or cookies?
    - How does session management impact scalability and performance?

19. **Third-Party Libraries and Frameworks:**
    - Are there any third-party libraries, frameworks, or components that the application relies on?
    - How might these external dependencies affect performance?

20. **Testing Environment Realism:**
    - How closely does the testing environment resemble the production environment?
    - Are there any differences in hardware, network configurations, or software versions?

21. **Scaling Strategy:**
    - How does the application scale in response to increased user loads? (e.g., horizontal scaling, vertical scaling)
    - Are there any automatic scaling mechanisms in place?

22. **Load Testing Scenarios:**
    - Are there specific scenarios you want to test, such as peak load, gradual ramp-up, or sustained load?
    - Are there any specific user interactions or transactions that should be emphasized in testing?

23. **Response Time Expectations:**
    - What are the acceptable response time thresholds for different types of interactions?
    - How do these thresholds vary based on user roles and tasks?

24. **Resource Monitoring and Metrics:**
    - What metrics or tools are used to monitor the application's resource utilization during testing?
    - How will you measure CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network usage?

25. **Recovery and Failover Testing:**
    - How does the application recover from failures, crashes, or unexpected errors?
    - Have failover mechanisms been tested for high availability scenarios?

26. **Long-Term Trends:**
    - Are there any expected changes or updates to the application in the near future?
    - How might these changes impact capacity requirements?

These questions will provide a solid foundation for planning and conducting performance tests that accurately reflect the software's capacity requirements and potential challenges.

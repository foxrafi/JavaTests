**Introduction**

In the dynamic realm of software performance, our Performance Test Team embarked on a transformative mission: the STAR NB Liquidation Load Test. Beyond showcasing our testing expertise, this venture nurtured a symbiotic relationship with the STAR Team. Immerse in the STAR architecture, we adapted our testing framework to align seamlessly with this unique project.

Yet our commitment transcended conventional testing. We meticulously restructured Neoload tests, secured access to both test and production servers, and harnessed Splunk indexes for profound insights. A significant ongoing initiative involves reactivating the traffic proxy tool, a gateway to in-depth analysis of backend traffic.

This voyage has not only uncovered fundamental baseline performance metrics for the NB Liquidation application but also positioned us as continual contributors to its refinement. Our narrative unfolds the intricacies of this journey—forging bonds, fine-tuning frameworks, and setting performance yardsticks—underscoring our resolute dedication to pursuing software excellence.

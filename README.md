Certainly, here's the list of standard performance metrics and parameters for databases with only the descriptions:

1. Throughput:
   - Measures the number of transactions or queries a database can handle in a given time period.

2. Latency:
   - The time delay between sending a request to the database and receiving a response.

3. Response Time:
   - The time it takes for the database to process a request and send a complete response back to the user.

4. Concurrency:
   - The ability of a DBMS to handle multiple transactions or queries simultaneously without conflicts.

5. Resource Utilization:
   - Measures how effectively the database uses available hardware resources.

6. Locking and Blocking:
   - Metrics related to managing concurrent transactions and avoiding contention.

7. Index Utilization:
   - Evaluates the efficiency of indexes in speeding up query performance.

8. Query Execution Time:
   - Measures the time it takes for a specific query to complete.

9. Buffer Pool Hit Ratio:
   - Measures how often data is retrieved from the cache rather than disk.

10. I/O Performance:
    - Evaluates how efficiently data is read from and written to storage.

11. Database Size and Growth:
    - Monitors database size and its growth rate.

12. Backup and Recovery Time:
    - Measures the time for data backups and restoration in case of failures.

13. Uptime and Availability:
    - Measures the percentage of time the database is operational and accessible.

14. Query Plan Analysis:
    - Examines query execution plans to identify inefficient processing.

15. Deadlock Analysis:
    - Assesses the occurrence of deadlocks, where transactions are blocked indefinitely.

16. Resource Contention:
    - Tracks contention for shared resources like locks and threads.

17. Cache Utilization:
    - Measures how effectively data is stored in memory caches.

18. Connection Pooling Efficiency:
    - Evaluates how efficiently connections are reused and managed.

19. Query Abandonment Rate:
    - Indicates the percentage of queries that users abandon.

20. Error Rate:
    - Measures the frequency of errors encountered during database operations.

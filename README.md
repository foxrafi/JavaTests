Certainly, here's a list of standard performance parameters to consider when evaluating the performance of Citrix applications, which are applications accessed via Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (formerly known as XenApp and XenDesktop):

1. **User Session Latency:**
   - Measures the delay experienced by users between input actions and corresponding application responses.

2. **Session Load Time:**
   - Measures the time it takes for a user session to load and become usable after initiating the connection.

3. **Network Bandwidth Utilization:**
   - Monitors the amount of network bandwidth used by Citrix sessions to ensure efficient network utilization.

4. **CPU and Memory Utilization:**
   - Tracks the usage of CPU and memory resources on the Citrix server to prevent resource bottlenecks.

5. **Session Connection Time:**
   - Measures the time taken for users to establish a connection to the Citrix environment.

6. **Application Launch Time:**
   - Measures the time it takes for applications to launch and become interactive within a user session.

7. **User Logon Time:**
   - Measures the time it takes for users to log in to the Citrix environment and access their sessions.

8. **Profile Load Time:**
   - Measures the time it takes to load user profiles and settings for a Citrix session.

9. **Print Job Processing Time:**
   - Measures the time taken to process and deliver print jobs from a Citrix session to a local or network printer.

10. **Session Responsiveness During Load:**
    - Evaluates how well the application responds to user interactions under heavy load conditions.

11. **Application Compatibility:**
    - Checks for compatibility issues between the Citrix environment and applications, ensuring smooth performance.

12. **Session Idle Timeouts:**
    - Monitors and manages the timeout settings for idle Citrix sessions to optimize resource usage.

13. **Application Crashes and Hangs:**
    - Tracks instances of application crashes or session hangs that impact user experience.

14. **Virtual Machine Density:**
    - Evaluates the number of virtual machines hosted on a single physical server to ensure resource allocation efficiency.

15. **Application Performance During Network Fluctuations:**
    - Assesses how Citrix applications perform when there are fluctuations in network quality.

16. **User Experience Index:**
    - Measures overall user satisfaction with the Citrix environment, considering factors like latency and responsiveness.

17. **Resource Scaling and Load Balancing:**
    - Evaluates the effectiveness of resource scaling and load balancing mechanisms to optimize performance.

18. **Session Disconnects and Reconnects:**
    - Tracks the frequency of session disconnects and user-initiated reconnections.

19. **Endpoint Device Compatibility:**
    - Ensures that Citrix applications perform well on different endpoint devices, such as laptops, tablets, and thin clients.

20. **Application Update Impact:**
    - Measures the impact of application updates or changes on Citrix performance and user experience.

These performance parameters are essential for delivering a seamless and responsive experience to users accessing applications through Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops. Regular monitoring and optimization of these factors can help ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction.

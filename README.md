Certainly, here's a list of Microsoft SQL Server specific performance metric parameters:

1. **Batch Requests/Sec:**
   - Measures the number of batches submitted to SQL Server per second. Represents the overall query and transaction workload.

2. **SQL Compilations/Sec and SQL Recompilations/Sec:**
   - Compilations per second indicate the number of times SQL statements are compiled, and recompilations per second represent the number of times execution plans are recompiled. High values may indicate potential performance issues.

3. **Buffer Cache Hit Ratio:**
   - Measures the percentage of data pages found in the buffer cache, indicating how effectively frequently accessed data is stored in memory.

4. **Page Life Expectancy (PLE):**
   - Represents the average time a data page remains in memory, indicating the effectiveness of the buffer cache. Higher PLE values generally indicate better memory usage.

5. **Latch Waits/Sec:**
   - Indicates the number of latch requests per second that are waiting, which can highlight contention and bottlenecks.

6. **Lock Waits/Sec:**
   - Measures the number of lock requests per second that are waiting due to contention. High values may indicate locking issues.

7. **Average Wait Time (Milliseconds) - Disk and Memory:**
   - Represents the average time a request spends waiting for disk I/O or memory resources. Helps identify potential storage or memory performance problems.

8. **Batch Duration and Avg. Request Duration:**
   - Measures the time taken for batch execution or individual query requests. Helps identify slow-performing queries.

9. **Plan Cache Hit Ratio:**
   - Measures the ratio of cached query plans to total query plans. A higher ratio suggests better cache utilization and fewer unnecessary compilations.

10. **TempDB I/O and Allocation Metrics:**
    - Includes metrics like TempDB space used, number of tempdb file allocations, and tempdb-related I/O statistics. Helps manage TempDB performance.

11. **Deadlocks:**
    - Tracks the occurrence of deadlocks, where two or more sessions are blocked indefinitely.

12. **Blocked Processes:**
    - Identifies currently blocked processes and their associated blockers, helping to diagnose and resolve blocking issues.

13. **Wait Statistics:**
    - Provides insights into the types of waits encountered by SQL Server processes, helping to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

14. **SQL Server Agent Job Performance:**
    - Monitors the execution and performance of SQL Server Agent jobs, including execution times and success/failure rates.

15. **Database Size and Space Usage:**
    - Tracks database sizes and the allocation and usage of data and log files.

16. **Database Growth Rate:**
    - Measures the rate at which databases are growing in size, helping to plan for future storage needs.

17. **Index Fragmentation:**
    - Monitors the fragmentation levels of indexes to optimize performance through periodic maintenance.

18. **Database Backup and Restore Times:**
    - Tracks the time taken for database backups and restores, ensuring data protection and quick recovery.

19. **CPU Usage and Queues:**
    - Monitors CPU utilization and identifies CPU bottlenecks.

20. **Memory Usage and Resource Pools:**
    - Tracks memory usage and helps manage resource allocation for different workloads using resource governor.

Remember that the importance of these metrics may vary based on your specific SQL Server deployment, workload, and objectives. Regular monitoring and analysis of these metrics can provide insights into the health and performance of your SQL Server environment.

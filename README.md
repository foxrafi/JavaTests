Before running software performance tests, it's important to gather relevant information from the development team to ensure that the tests are accurate and comprehensive. Here are some key questions to ask the development team regarding capacity before conducting performance tests:

1. **Expected User Load:**
   - What is the expected number of concurrent users or transactions that the system needs to support?
   - Are there any peak usage times or specific events that could cause a spike in user activity?

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Can you provide details about different types of users and their behaviors? (e.g., regular users, power users, administrators)
   - Do different user roles have different access levels or permissions?

3. **Data Volume and Variability:**
   - What is the size of the typical dataset that the application will be working with?
   - Are there scenarios where the dataset size could increase significantly?

4. **Data Growth:**
   - How fast is the data expected to grow over time? (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly growth rates)
   - Are there mechanisms in place for data archiving or cleanup?

5. **Hardware and Infrastructure:**
   - What is the underlying hardware and infrastructure setup? (e.g., server specifications, network configuration)
   - Are there load balancers or other components that distribute traffic?

6. **Third-Party Integrations:**
   - Are there any external services or APIs that the application relies on?
   - What is the expected response time and reliability of these external services?

7. **Caching and Optimization:**
   - Are there caching mechanisms in place? (e.g., database caching, content delivery networks)
   - Are there any performance optimization techniques that have been implemented?

8. **Database and Storage:**
   - What type of database is being used? (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)
   - How is the database schema structured? Are there any indexing strategies in place?

9. **Scalability and Redundancy:**
   - How does the application handle horizontal or vertical scaling?
   - Are there plans for failover mechanisms or redundancy in case of hardware or software failures?

10. **Current Performance Metrics:**
    - Are there any existing performance metrics or benchmarks that the team monitors?
    - Are there any known performance bottlenecks or issues?

11. **Development and Test Environments:**
    - What environments (e.g., development, testing, staging, production) will the software be deployed to?
    - Are the test environments representative of the production environment?

12. **Performance Testing Goals:**
    - What are the specific goals of the performance tests? (e.g., response time, throughput, resource utilization)
    - Are there any specific scenarios or use cases that need to be tested?

By gathering answers to these questions, you'll have a better understanding of the application's expected capacity requirements and potential bottlenecks. This information will guide your performance testing strategy and help you design tests that accurately reflect real-world usage scenarios.

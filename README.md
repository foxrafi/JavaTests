Subject: Enhancement Request: GDPR Compliance Feature - Employee Data Removal in Tricentis qTest

Dear Tricentis qTest Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. We have been using Tricentis qTest as our preferred test management software, and we greatly appreciate the features it offers for streamlining our testing processes. However, we have identified a significant gap in the product's functionality concerning General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance, specifically related to the removal of employee names and last names when they leave the company.

As part of our commitment to data privacy and compliance, we are required to ensure that employee data, including personal identifying information, is managed and processed in accordance with GDPR regulations. Currently, when an employee leaves our organization, we face challenges in maintaining GDPR compliance while retaining vital testing assets, such as defects, test executions, and test plans, which were created by the departing employee.

To address this concern, we kindly request the addition of a GDPR compliance feature that allows us to effectively remove employee names and last names from the Tricentis qTest system while preserving their associated testing artifacts. The proposed feature should achieve the following:

1. Anonymization of Employee Data: Enable the anonymization of employee names and last names in the system. This could involve replacing the original names with unique identifiers or pseudonyms, ensuring that personal information is no longer identifiable.

2. Retention of Testing Artifacts: Ensure that defects, test executions, and test plans associated with the departing employee remain intact and traceable, even after their personal information has been anonymized.

3. Administrative Controls: Provide administrative controls and permissions to authorized personnel, allowing them to initiate the anonymization process for specific employees while safeguarding data integrity.

4. Audit Trail: Maintain a comprehensive audit trail or log of anonymization activities, detailing the changes made, the individuals involved, and the timestamp of the action.

5. Data Privacy Best Practices: Incorporate data privacy best practices and guidance to help organizations adhere to GDPR regulations and ensure the effective use of the new feature.

We believe that the addition of this GDPR compliance feature would not only enhance the data privacy capabilities of Tricentis qTest but also provide peace of mind to organizations like ours that prioritize regulatory compliance.

We understand that software development and feature implementation can take time, and we appreciate your consideration of this enhancement request. If possible, we would be grateful for updates on the development progress and an estimated timeline for the release of this feature.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your positive response and the continued collaboration with Tricentis qTest to improve our testing processes while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and compliance.

Best regards,

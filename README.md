Subject: Urgent: Request for Updated Data in Excel Document

Dear [Team Members' Names],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an important matter regarding the recent data update request for the Excel document.

As you may recall, on Monday, I reached out to the leadership team with a request to update certain data points in the Excel document by Wednesday EOD. This information was crucial for the report I subsequently created, and I assumed that all necessary updates had been made based on the progress at that time.

However, I have since learned that some data was not updated as intended, leading to discrepancies in the report I published. I understand that oversights can happen, and it's important for us to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our reports.

I kindly ask that those who were unable to complete the data updates by the initial deadline please take immediate action to enter the up-to-date information into the Excel document. This will help us rectify the discrepancies and ensure the accuracy of the report moving forward.

To facilitate this process, I have extended the deadline for the data updates to [New Deadline: Date and Time]. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Please prioritize this task to help us maintain the integrity of our reporting process. Should you encounter any challenges or require assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Together, we can ensure that our reports reflect the most current and accurate information.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

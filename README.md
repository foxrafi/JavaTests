Certainly, here's a list of standard performance parameters to consider when evaluating the performance of mainframe applications:

1. **Transaction Throughput:**
   - Measures the number of transactions processed by the mainframe application per unit of time.

2. **Response Time:**
   - Measures the time it takes for the mainframe application to respond to user requests or complete transactions.

3. **CPU Utilization:**
   - Monitors the usage of the central processing unit (CPU) to ensure efficient utilization and avoid bottlenecks.

4. **Memory Utilization:**
   - Tracks the usage of main memory (RAM) to ensure efficient usage and prevent memory-related performance issues.

5. **I/O Performance:**
   - Evaluates the efficiency of input/output operations, including disk and tape access, to prevent I/O bottlenecks.

6. **Database Access Time:**
   - Measures the time it takes for the mainframe application to access and retrieve data from databases.

7. **Batch Processing Time:**
   - Measures the time taken to process batches of transactions or jobs.

8. **Transaction Abandonment Rate:**
   - Indicates the percentage of transactions that users abandon due to long response times.

9. **Job Completion Rate:**
   - Measures the rate at which scheduled jobs or tasks are completed by the mainframe application.

10. **Resource Contention:**
    - Monitors contention for shared resources like locks, tapes, and I/O devices that can impact application performance.

11. **Connectivity Performance:**
    - Evaluates the performance of communication links between mainframe systems and external systems.

12. **Subsystem Performance (e.g., CICS, IMS):**
    - Monitors the performance of specific subsystems that the mainframe application relies on for transaction processing.

13. **Transaction Queues and Backlogs:**
    - Tracks the number of transactions queued up for processing and identifies potential bottlenecks.

14. **Security and Access Control:**
    - Measures the impact of security mechanisms on application performance, such as user authentication and authorization.

15. **Batch Job Scheduling Efficiency:**
    - Monitors the efficiency of scheduling and managing batch jobs to ensure optimal resource allocation.

16. **Batch Job Abnormal Terminations:**
    - Tracks the occurrence of batch jobs that terminate abnormally, which could impact application reliability and performance.

17. **Print and Output Processing Time:**
    - Measures the time taken to generate and deliver printed output or electronic reports.

18. **Capacity Planning and Scalability:**
    - Evaluates the application's ability to handle increased workloads and scale with growing demand.

19. **Database Locking and Deadlocks:**
    - Monitors database locks and identifies potential deadlocks that can impact application performance.

20. **Change Impact Analysis:**
    - Evaluates the impact of changes to the mainframe environment on application performance and stability.

These performance parameters are crucial for ensuring the efficiency, reliability, and optimal functioning of mainframe applications in complex computing environments. Regular monitoring and optimization can help maintain the desired level of performance and user satisfaction.

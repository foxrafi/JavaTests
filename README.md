Certainly, Google's Core Web Vitals are a set of specific user-centric performance metrics that aim to measure and improve the loading, interactivity, and visual stability of web pages. Here are the Core Web Vitals defined by Google:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):**
   - Measures loading performance.
   - LCP reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport.
   - Good: LCP occurs within 2.5 seconds of when the page starts loading.

2. **First Input Delay (FID):**
   - Measures interactivity performance.
   - FID quantifies the delay from a user's first interaction (click, tap, etc.) to the browser's response.
   - Good: FID is less than 100 milliseconds.

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):**
   - Measures visual stability.
   - CLS quantifies unexpected layout shifts of visual page content.
   - Good: CLS is less than 0.1.

These metrics focus on providing a user-centered view of web performance, considering aspects such as load time, interactivity, and visual stability. Google considers these Core Web Vitals as crucial for delivering a better user experience and recommends optimizing for them to improve website performance.

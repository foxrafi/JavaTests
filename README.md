Subject: Workflow Update for Handling Tickets Requiring Data Protection Review

Dear Team,

I'd like to inform you that a recent update has been made to our project's workflow in response to the issue of missing system owner approvals for certain tickets. The necessary adjustments have been communicated to the Jira support team.

Moving forward, any tickets that are impacted by the absence of system owner approval will now be reassigned to the Data Protection Team. This step is intended to ensure a thorough review of these tickets. Once the Data Protection Team has granted their approval, the tickets will then be forwarded to the QM Approval Team for further processing.

I'm pleased to announce that the requested change has been successfully implemented. To facilitate a smooth transition, the Data Protection Team is expected to diligently monitor their mailboxes on a daily basis. This will ensure a prompt response in case of any issues that may arise.

Should you have any inquiries regarding this workflow adjustment or encounter any challenges during its implementation, please do not hesitate to reach out. Your feedback and questions are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

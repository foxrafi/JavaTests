Subject: Proposal for Refinement of Requirements Folder Structure in QTest Project Template

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I would like to discuss a potential enhancement to our current requirements folder structure in the QTest project template.

The existing folder structure is presented as a suggestion for development teams, allowing them the flexibility to tailor it to their preferences. In practice, teams often devise their own structures, maintaining autonomy over their organization. Currently, the suggested framework is more in line with the traditional software development lifecycle, particularly suited for a waterfall or phased approach.

Your proposed structure, on the other hand, aligns seamlessly with an agile or feature-driven development process. It promotes a targeted focus on features and user stories, catering to the dynamic nature of such methodologies. Additionally, there is a third option—a hybrid approach—that combines elements of both. In this scenario, top-level folders correspond to each software development phase, with subfolders dedicated to individual features within those phases.

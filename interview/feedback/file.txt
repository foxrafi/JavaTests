I trust this message finds you well. I would like to provide feedback on the interview conducted yesterday with the candidate for the Senior Performance Test position. While the candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of conceptual aspects, including the performance testing process and standard software performance issues, there were notable challenges when responding to technical questions posed by the second interviewer.

In assessing the candidate's seniority level for our performance testing team, it became evident that the depth of technical expertise required for the role may not align with our expectations. The candidate faced difficulties addressing specific technical inquiries, raising concerns about their readiness for the senior responsibilities associated with the position.

After careful consideration, we have concluded that the candidate may not be the ideal fit for our team's current needs. We appreciate the effort invested in the interview process and acknowledge the strengths demonstrated by the candidate at a conceptual level. However, we believe it is in the best interest of both parties to explore alternative candidates who better match the technical proficiency required for this senior role.

We kindly request your assistance in identifying and presenting additional candidates who possess the requisite seniority and technical acumen to meet our team's specific requirements. We value our partnership and trust that together, we can identify a candidate who aligns more closely with the expectations of our performance testing team.

Thank you for your understanding and continued collaboration. We look forward to reviewing additional candidates and appreciate your ongoing support in this hiring process.

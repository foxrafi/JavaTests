Subject: Request for Remote Work due to Family Situation

Hey [Boss's Name],

I've got a bit of a sensitive matter I wanted to talk to you about. Recently, my wife had an unfortunate accident, and it looks like she might have a slipped disc in her spine. Tomorrow, she's scheduled for a tomography to get a clearer picture. Due to this, I need to be with her and also take care of picking up our two little ones from school and daycare.

Any chance I could work remotely until the end of next week? Seriously, the situation is a bit crazy, and I don't want it to affect my work. I promise to give it my all, even from a distance.

Thanks in advance for understanding, and I hope it's just a temporary mess.

Best,
